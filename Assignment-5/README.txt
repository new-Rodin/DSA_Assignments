INTRO- this project aims at learning and understanding basic operations of hash and heaps

DESCRIPTION- 
-The example used to implement heaps is the heapSort algorithm in which the maximum element at the top of the heap is replaced with the minimum element and the array is heaified again to obtain a valid heap. this process is repeated until array is sorted
- Example used to implement hash- counting the frequency of the no.s apprearing in an array using hash.

EXECUTION-
